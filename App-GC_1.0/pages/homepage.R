Data preprocessing is the most crucial step in untargeted metabolomics, since it has direct impact on subsequent statistical analysis and biological interpretation. Therefore, we developed R-based pipeline, App-GC that integrates open-source methods to preprocess GC-MS and GCxGC-MS data. The pipeline consists of two modes, 1D mode for GC-MS data and 2D mode for GCxGC-MS data, each of which contains four main steps 1) peak detection, 2) peak export, 3) peak alignment, and 4) peak annotation.</p>"),
